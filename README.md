# Hi! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub repository.

I’m a **Software Engineer** with over a decade of experience building, evolving, and leading software projects across the stack. This space is where I share experiments, reference implementations, architectural ideas, and practical solutions drawn from real-world systems.

My work spans backend and frontend development, with a strong focus on **scalability, maintainability, and developer experience**. Whether you’re an engineer, tech lead, or simply curious about how modern systems are built, I hope you find something useful here.

## 🧠 About Me

I have hands-on experience designing and implementing distributed systems, APIs, and user-facing applications. Over the years, I’ve:

- Built and evolved **scalable architectures**
- Improved **engineering workflows and delivery processes**
- Led and collaborated with teams on complex, long-running projects
- Balanced **technical excellence** with **pragmatic decision-making**

I strongly believe that great software is the result of **clear communication, collaboration, and thoughtful trade-offs**, not just technical skill.

My focus is always on delivering software that is:
- Reliable  
- Efficient  
- Maintainable  
- Genuinely useful to the people who use it
